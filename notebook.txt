=========================
Progress:
- Started basic client/machine code
- Implemented basic server code to connect client comms
- Client can send message any of the two (or both) other clients

Questions:
- Are the clients supposed to connect to each other? Or should we have a central 
  server "brokering" the communication?
    - For now we are implementing with a server but will see Ed feedback
